Test Automation Study Project
This is a test automation project that I created to practice my automation skills using Selenium and Java.

Project Description
The project is a basic automation test suite for a sample web application called "The Internet". The test suite covers the following scenarios:

Login with valid credentials
Login with invalid credentials
Add and remove items to/from the shopping cart
Complete the checkout process
The test suite uses Selenium WebDriver with Java to interact with the browser and perform the test scenarios.

Installation and Setup
Clone the repository
Install Java and Maven
Install Chrome or Firefox web browser
Run mvn test to execute the test suite
